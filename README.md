Bing stores and uses your search history to personalize your results. And clearing the history in your web browser doesn’t touch the history stored on Bing itself, which likely comes from multiple devices you use. You can clear that history, though.

## How To Clear Your Bing History

Your history for all the things you search for using Bing are stored on your Microsoft account, so head on over to your Microsoft account’s privacy settings, and sign in.

After signing in, you’ll see your account’s Privacy dashboard. Scroll down a bit to the “Search History” section, and then click “View And Clear Search History” button.

This opens the “Activity History” tab of your dashboard, and puts the focus on your past searches. If what you want to do is clear your entire search history, you can just click the “Clear Activity” link at the top right of your search list.

You’ll be asked confirm your action. If you want to delete your entire search history, go ahead and click the “Clear” button.

If you don’t want to delete everything, you can also scroll down to view your search history.

Under each individual search entry, you’ll notice two links, click “Delete” to get rid of just that search result.

And that’s pretty much all there is to it.

But, if you find that you’re using Bing, and coming to clear your history every once in a while, you might want to consider using private browsing so that searches aren’t stored in the first place.
